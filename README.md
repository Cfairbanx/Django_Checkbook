# Django_Checkbook
 

Create an app using Django that keeps track of various bank accounts.

Track the following information from the user:
  First Name

  Last Name

  Starting Balance

The user is then able to add transactions to the account, including the following information:
  Date of Transaction

  Type of Transaction (e.g., Deposit or Withdrawal)

  Amount

  Description

  Account it applies to

The application allows the user to see their current bank account balance and all transactions that apply to it.

The user is able to select from the main page to view an account - with a drop down form made up of names, or create a new account.
